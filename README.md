## Getting started

Clone this repository to your system:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DataAnalyticsEngineering/DiffuXion
cd DiffuXion
```

We recommend using [pixi](https://pixi.sh/) to effortlessly set up an isolated environment with all required dependencies:

```bash
# Install pixi if not done already
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | sh

# Create the environment with all dependencies
pixi install
```

In general you can open a pixi environment shell via `pixi shell`. 


Start the interactive interface to configure, run and visualize your simulations:

```bash
pixi run start
```

This will call `marimo run examples/run.py` in the background.
